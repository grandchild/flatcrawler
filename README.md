# Flatcrawler

A little script to crawl certain housing association websites for new flats.

## How it works

The configuration takes a list of website URLs which are searched for certain strings,
that indicate whether any appartments are available or not. If there are, all URLs
pointing to exposes are extracted via a pattern, and sent out in an email.

## Usage

Copy `config-default.py` to a new `config.py` and edit the `MailConfig` class at the
bottom to include your email address and your login password.

You can also add new webpages in `sites.py` along the lines of the existing ones... Let
me know (create an issue, or a pull request maybe) if there are any more one should add.

## Python

Uses f-strings ðŸ¤© and thus needs python 3.6 or higher.

## Dependencies

* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install)
* [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)

## systemd

You can create systemd service and timer files from the script itself by calling it with
the parameter `service` and `timer` respectively:

```bash
./crawler.py service > ~/.local/share/systemd/user/flatcrawler.service
./crawler.py timer > ~/.local/share/systemd/user/flatcrawler.timer
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now flatcrawler.timer
```

The timer defaults to a one hour interval (delayed randomly by up to 15min).

Check that the timer is running with:

```bash
systemctl --user status flatcrawler.timer
```
